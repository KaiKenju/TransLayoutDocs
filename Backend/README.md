## To do list
- [ ] Handle file size (max ~= 50MB).
- [ ] Host db on server using Docker.
- [ ] Calculate time execution.


### Instruction

0. Put the private files into Backend/ folder (.env and .json files)

1. Create a new virtual environment with Python and activate it.

```
cd Backend/
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

**Suggestion**: Using `conda` with `python=3.8` if you don't want to use Python venv.

2. Install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application (make sure you have PostgreSQL running on your machine and please change the database settings in settings.py to your own database settings...)

- If you have `bash/zsh/sh/...` shells, just replace with the `<shell>` that you have. For example, you have `bash`:
    ```
    bash setup.sh
    ```
- Else:
    ```
    gdown --id 1Jx2m_2I1d9PYzFRQ4gl82xQa-G7Vsnsl
    python -m pip install -e ../.
    python manage.py makemigrations account translation python manage.py migrate 
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
4. *(Optional - Should use when running on a server)* Deploy Backend on **ngrok**

- Open a new terminal and run **ngrok**:
    ```
    ngrok http 8000
    ```

- If not using **ngrok**, just use the localhost [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
